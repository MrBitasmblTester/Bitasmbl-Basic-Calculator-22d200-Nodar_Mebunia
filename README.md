# Bitasmbl-Basic-Calculator-22d200-Nodar_Mebunia

## Description
Create a simple web-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project focuses on interactive UI, event handling, and state management.

## Tech Stack
- Nuxt.js

## Requirements
- Perform basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Update the display dynamically when buttons are clicked
- Handle edge cases such as division by zero
- Provide a clear and intuitive layout for buttons and display

## Installation
bash
git clone https://github.com/MrBitasmblTester/Bitasmbl-Basic-Calculator-22d200-Nodar_Mebunia.git
cd Bitasmbl-Basic-Calculator-22d200-Nodar_Mebunia
npm install


## Usage
bash
npm run dev

Open the local URL shown in the terminal.

## Implementation Steps
1. Initialize a Nuxt.js project structure.
2. Create a main calculator page with display and buttons layout.
3. Implement state management for current input and operation.
4. Add event handlers for button clicks and display updates.
5. Implement arithmetic logic including division by zero handling.
6. Test UI interactions and edge cases.
